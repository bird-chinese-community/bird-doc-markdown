## Getting more help

If you use BIRD, you're welcome to join the bird-users mailing list
(<bird-users@network.cz>)
where you can share your experiences with the other users and consult
your problems with the authors. To subscribe to the list, visit
<http://bird.network.cz/?m_list>.
The home page of BIRD can be found at <http://bird.network.cz/>.

BIRD is a relatively young system and it probably contains some bugs. You can
report any problems to the bird-users list and the authors will be glad to solve
them, but before you do so, please make sure you have read the available
documentation and that you are running the latest version (available at
[bird.network.cz:/pub/bird](ftp://bird.network.cz/pub/bird)).
(Of course, a patch which fixes the bug is always welcome as an attachment.)

If you want to understand what is going inside, Internet standards are a good
and interesting reading. You can get them from
[ftp.rfc-editor.org](ftp://ftp.rfc-editor.org/) (or a
nicely sorted version from [atrey.karlin.mff.cuni.cz:/pub/rfc](ftp://atrey.karlin.mff.cuni.cz/pub/rfc)).

*Good luck!*
